tested on Galaxy Nexus phones running a 4.0.2 build ICL53F. 

MeshOnAndroid (MOA) only works on rooted phones with WEXT (wireless extension) support.
If you have a rooted phone with a kernel that support WEXT, pls give it a try and let me know how it works.
 It's only been tested on 4.0.2 ICL53F on galaxy nexi.

steps to configure Galaxy Nexus for MOA:
1. revert to stock 4.0.2 build ICL53F
2. root
3. download and flash 'myupdate-galaxynexus.zip' kindly made publicly available at https://github.com/monk-dot/SPAN/tree/master/kernels/Samsung%20Galaxy%20Nexus
4. mkdir /data/mybin and cp he included 'iwconfig' and 'init.sh' files
5. chmod 0777 iwconfig and init.sh
6. install MeshOnAndroid and enjoy!

For best results you can install ProxyDroid from the android market, to direct all HTTP requests apps on your phone make to MOA.
