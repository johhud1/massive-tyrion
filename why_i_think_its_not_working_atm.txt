think i understand what the problem may be with the ProxyThread and update() function. The update function for each ProxyThread is called, regardless of whether the pdu_msg's are 
intended for that thread. 

I'm guessing this is the sequence of events.

1. Press button, set webview to load '192.168.1.1'
2. initial http request for 192.168.1.1 arrives at proxy. ProxyThread1 is spawned
3. ProxyThread1 sends off ExitNodeReq
4. ProxyThread1 hears ExitNodeRep
5. ProxyThread1 sends off DataReqMsg with http request for '192.168.1.1'
6. ProxyThread1 gets DataRepMsg with response, forwards this back to webview
7. webview parses the response, sends off http request for subsequent resources (.css .gifs, etc.)
8. Each of these requests spawns a proxyThread. (ProxyThread2 through PRoxyThreadN)
9. Each of these proxyThreads sends out an exitNodeReq, and upon hearing an exitNodeRep, sends their particular request. 
	Since each (n) proxyThreads sent an ExitNodeReq, and they don't distinguish between ExitNodeReps intended for one or the other each one will send a 
	DataReqMsg upon hearing an ExitNodeRep, resulting in each proxyThread sending N DataReqMsg's. (N*N total dataReqMsgs)
10. similar confusion happens upon each of the proxyThreads recieving the DataRepMsgs.
